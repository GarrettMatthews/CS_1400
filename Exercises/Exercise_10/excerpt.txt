I live in the oldest city in the world. Long before there were kings in Karhide, Rer was a city, the marketplace and meeting ground for all the Northeast, the Plains, and Kerm Land. The Fastness of Rer was a center of learning, a refuge, a judgment seat fifteen thousand years ago. Karhide  became a nation here, under the Geger kings, who ruled for a thousand years.  In the thousandth year Sedern Geger, the Unking, cast the crown into the River  Arre from the palace towers, proclaiming an end to dominion. The time they  call the Flowering of Rer, the Summer Century, began then. It ended when the  Hearth of Harge took power and moved their capital across the mountains to  Erhenrang. The Old Palace has been empty for centuries. But it stands. Nothing  in Rer falls down. The Arre floods through the street-tunnels every year in  the Thaw, winter blizzards may bring thirty feet of snow, but the city stands.  Nobody knows how old the houses are, because they have been rebuilt forever.  Each one sits in its gardens without respect to the position of any of the  others, as vast and random and ancient as hills. The roofed streets and canals  angle about among them. Rer is all corners. We say that the Harges left  because they were afraid of what might be around the corner.
